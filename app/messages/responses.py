help_message="""Lingo: Dear <b>{name}</b>, you can talk to me via text message or voice in the language of your choice.
None of your personal information is saved by me and only the content of the last five messages remains in my temporary memory so that the sequence of responses is logical.
I use artificial intelligence GPT-4.0 and GPT-3.5, which you can choose to use in the /settings section.

Version 4.0 is more powerful, but the cost of using it is about 5 times more.
Each account has an initial charge, and if it runs out, you can send up to {free_quota} text or voice messages with GPT-3.5 version.

Instructions guide:
ðŸ”¹ /settings - settings
ðŸ”¹ /image - creating an image from the text
ðŸ”¹ /balance - inventory
ðŸ”¹ /help â€“ Help
